introduction= \
  <p>This specification defines a JSON binding for an event which announces that a \n\
  particular GradebookItem resource has been deleted.  The event itself is enriched with limited \n\
  information about the GradebookItem including the resource's URI value, and \n\
  the lastModified timestamp which specifies the date and time when resource was deleted.</p>\n\
  <p>Conceptually, a GradebookItem is similar to an IMS LIS LineItem resource; \n\
  it is a container that holds scores (i.e. Result resources).  However, \n\
  Pearson is using a slightly different data model to represent these resources \n\
  than the standard IMS data model.</p>  \n\
  <p>The binding defined in this specification conforms to the JSON-LD conventions      \n\
  [JSON-LD-syntax].  Briefly, JSON-LD adds semantics to a JSON document by              \n\
  associating properties that may appear in a document with well-defined data types     \n\
   through the use of a so-called "context".   It is not necessary to understand the    \n\
   mechanics of JSON-LD to render a JSON document that complies with the binding        \n\
   defined by this specification.  Indeed, this specification is self-contained         \n\
   in the sense that it provides all the information necessary to render a              \n\
   compliant JSON binding of a GradebookItem object.  On the other hand, readers        \n\
   who have some familiarity with JSON-LD will likely find this specification           \n\
   document easier to digest.</p>
