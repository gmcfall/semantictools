This practice is especially common with <code>Assignment</code> resources. An Instructor might start with some source Assignment and then create a new variant that differs only in the number of points assigned to certain items.  The two assignments (the original and the new one with a modified point distribution) are substantially the same resource but they are not identical. </p>
<p>Technically, you can think of a VersionHistory as an <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class\">equivalence class</a></em>.  It is a collection of activities which, roughly speaking, are equivalent to each other.  This concept is important when reporting on outcomes for cohorts larger than a single course section.</p>
<p>The VersionHistory concept is also useful in LTI integrations.  When creating a link to an Activity one might naively define a custom launch parameter which identifies the particular Activity of interest.  However, this practice can be dangerous. If the course section containing the link is copied, the new course section will end up containing a link to an assignment in the original course section.  One way to avoid this problem is to define a launch parameter which points to the VersionHistory instead of a particular instance of the Activity.  At runtime, when handling a launch request, the system must lookup the appropriate variant of the Activity that is available within the current learning context.</p>""" .
